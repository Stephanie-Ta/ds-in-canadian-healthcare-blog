## Introduction
Healthcare workers in Canada have high workloads and are facing burnout.
A 2021 survey run by the Canadian Medical Association found that 53% of 4,121 respondants
(phycisians, medical residents, and medical students) reported symptoms of burnout.

Administrative tasks particularly maintaining electronic health care records (EHRs), are a main contributor to the high workload of healthcare workers.
EHRs are "a longitudinal electronic record of patient health information [such as patient demographics, progress notes, problems, medications, vital signs, past medical history, immunizations, laboratory data, and radiology reports,] generated by one or more encounters in any care delivery setting" (Menachemi & Collum, 2011. p. 48).
Family physicians are particularly impacted by a high administrative workload.
The same 2021 survey run by the Canadian Medical Association found that family physicians are significantly more likely (61%) to spend an "excessive" or "moderately high" amount of time on EHRs compared to other types of physicians.
This is especially concerning because family physicians are the backbone of primary care -- the first-contact, accessible, continuous, comprehensive, and coordinated person-focused care (World Health Organization).

In recent years, artificial intelligence (AI) technology, in the form of AI scribes, has been developing and has the potential to alleviate the administrative workload of family physicians.

## So What Are AI Scribes and Their Benefits?
You may be familiar with using speech-to-text, AI scribes are similar!

Some physicians tend to dictate their medical notes to have them typed up later.
Instead of the doctor, medical office assistant, or medical scribe typing up the notes later, an AI scribe will automate this process and convert voice notes into typed notes in real-time.

Additionally, AI scribes can utilize natural language processing (NLP), which is a type of machine learning that allows computers to understand the meaning behind human language.
This allows for the AI scribe to be used during patient-physician interactions/appointments, identifying and recording the important points of the conversation that should be included in EHRs (Tali AI). 

As you may imagine, the use of AI scribes can reduce the administrative burden on family physicians can allow them to focus more of their time on patient care, which can have downstream benefits.
For example, family physicians may have time to see more patients, which can alleviate emergency department workloads and reduce wait times. 
Notably, the Canadian Institute for Health Information found that 1 in 7 visits to Canadian emergency departments between April 2023 and March 2024 could have been addressed with primary care.
